            <h2>Thanks for dropping by my site!</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a passionate full-stack developer with a love for creating beautiful,
                functional web applications. With experience in both frontend and backend
                development, I enjoy tackling complex problems and turning them into
                elegant solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of work, I’m someone who loves cooking, making coffee, and exploring new cafés, even if it means paying a little too much for that perfect colde brew. I enjoy finding creativity in everyday things, whether it’s experimenting in the kitchen or discovering a cozy spot to unwind with a good brew.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe the small passions in life fuel the big ones. Cooking teaches me patience and creativity, while coffee (besides keeping me awake) reminds me to slow down and enjoy the process.
            </p>
            <h2>Current Focus</h2>
            <p>
                I'm currently focused on developing <span class="highlight">a mobile app for English speakers to learn Cantonese</span>. This project combines my love for language learning with my technical skills to create an engaging educational tool.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm always excited to take on new challenges and collaborate with others on interesting projects. Whether it's building innovative applications or exploring new technologies, I'm constantly seeking opportunities to grow and make an impact.
            </p>
            <h2>Special thanks</h2>
            <p>
                Special thanks to <b>Ash</b>, who gave me my first real opportunity in the field through the <b>FanTipper project</b> while I was still at university. That experience sparked the journey I’m on today.
