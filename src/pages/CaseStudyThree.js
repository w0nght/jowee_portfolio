      <h2>ðŸŽ¯ Background</h2>
      <p>
        TAFE Queensland delivers online and blended learning to thousands of
        students across the state. While some older modules needed a refresh,
        the bigger challenge was producing <b>brand new content</b> â€” fast â€”
        that was consistent, interactive, and accessible.
      </p>
      <h2>ðŸª› Process</h2>
      <p>
        As a Multimedia Developer, I was hands-on in building{" "}
        <b>20+ new interactive modules</b>, while also modernizing a handful of
        legacy ones. My role included:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Collaborating with instructional designers to translate lesson plans
          into engaging, interactive learning experiences.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Developing 20+ brand-new modules</b> using HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript, optimized for both desktop and mobile learners.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Revamping a set of older modules</b> to improve usability, visual
          consistency, and accessibility compliance (WCAG).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Editing graphics and visual assets</b> in Photoshop and Illustrator
          to support the learning content.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Maintaining style guides</b> to ensure a consistent experience
          across all modules and make future updates easier for the team.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>ðŸ˜„ Outcome</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Delivered <b>20+ fully functional, modern modules</b> that improved
          learner engagement and comprehension.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Ensured WCAG accessibility compliance</b> so that every student
          could access course materials equally.
        </li>
        <li>
          Helped establish a <b>consistent, scalable design system</b>, reducing
          development time for future modules.
        </li>
