      <h2>ðŸŽ¯ Background</h2>
      <p>
        At Symbio Networks, our team was responsible for the provisioning
        systems behind <strong>ALDI Mobile</strong> â€” meaning every mobile
        recharge, data top-up, and SMS campaign had to work flawlessly for
        thousands of customers every single day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keeping these systems running wasnâ€™t just important â€” it was critical. A
        single failure could mean a customer couldnâ€™t recharge their plan or
        receive time-sensitive notifications.
      </p>
    </>
  );

      <h2>ðŸª› Process</h2>
      <p>
        I wore many hats in this role, combining development, monitoring, and QA
        to ensure everything worked seamlessly:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Configured custom Watcher alarms</strong> in the ELK Stack to
          proactively detect anomalies and trigger alerts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Analyzed Kibana logs</strong> to identify unusual patterns
          before they could impact customers â€” preventing issues before they
          escalated.
        </li>
        <li>
          Acted as <strong>interim QA</strong>, writing and executing test
          plans, testing endpoint APIs in Postman, and retesting fixes after
          deployment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Utilized <strong>GitLab CI/CD</strong> for automated deployments
          across 11 applications, monitoring build pipelines and resolving
          failures quickly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Provided <strong>after-hours support</strong> for critical processes,
          ensuring that customers had 24/7 service continuity.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}

function Outcome() {
  return (

      <h2>ðŸ˜„ Outcome</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Zero critical downtime</strong> incidents during my time in
          the role.
        </li>
        <li>
          Faster detection and resolution of anomalies, thanks to improved
          alerting and log analysis.
        </li>
        <li>
          A smoother experience for customers â€” mobile plans recharged reliably,
          and campaigns went out on schedule without hiccups.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </>
