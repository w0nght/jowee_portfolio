      <h2>ðŸŽ¯ Background</h2>
      <p>
        At Symbio Networks, our team was responsible for the provisioning
        systems behind <b>ALDI Mobile</b> â€” meaning every mobile recharge, data
        top-up, and SMS campaign had to work flawlessly for thousands of
        customers every single day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keeping these systems running wasnâ€™t just important â€” it was critical. A
        single failure could mean a customer couldnâ€™t recharge their plan or
        receive time-sensitive notifications.
      </p>
      <h2>ðŸª› Process</h2>
      <p>
        I wore many hats in this role, combining development, monitoring, and QA
        to ensure everything worked seamlessly:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Configured custom Watcher alarms</b> in the ELK Stack to
          proactively detect anomalies and trigger alerts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Analyzed Kibana logs</b> to identify unusual patterns before they
          could impact customers â€” preventing issues before they escalated.
        </li>
        <li>
          Acted as <b>interim QA</b>, writing and executing test plans, testing
          endpoint APIs in Postman, and retesting fixes after deployment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Utilized <b>GitLab CI/CD</b> for automated deployments across 11
          applications, monitoring build pipelines and resolving failures
          quickly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Provided <b>after-hours support</b> for critical processes, ensuring
          that customers had 24/7 service continuity.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>ðŸ˜„ Outcome</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Zero critical downtime</b> incidents during my time in the role.
        </li>
        <li>
          Faster detection and resolution of anomalies, thanks to improved
          alerting and log analysis.
        </li>
        <li>
          A smoother experience for customers â€” mobile plans recharged reliably,
          and campaigns went out on schedule without hiccups.
        </li>
      </ul>
