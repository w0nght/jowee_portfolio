## 🚀 Deployment

What I used: **Netlify for continuous deployment**

How I used it:

- Automatic deployment from GitHub on each push
- Netlify builds with `npm run build` and publishes from `build/`
- Handles HTTPS, CDN distribution, and PR previews

Alternative: Could have used Vercel or GitHub Pages, but Netlify offered the simplest workflow for React + custom domains.
